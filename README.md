## Godot Versions
- This is the version of the project for **Godot 3.5**.
- For the project for **Godot 4.2**, use the [master branch](https://github.com/alfredbaudisch/GodotDynamicInventorySystem).

## Project Features
Built from scratch, inspired by the Zelda Breath of the Wild inventory system and inventory UI, this is an extensive system:

-   **Fully Dynamic inventory and equipment system**: a database of items separated **by categories** and also **groups of categories**, for example,  **One Handed Weapons and Two Handed Weapons are grouped under a Weapons group**, while keeping the One and Two Handed classifications.
- **Custom Scriptable Objects (Custom Godot's Resources)** with different attributes for items and equipment, **grouped in a database of items** (folder based, with Resource files).
-   **Responsive layout** adjustable for different aspect ratios.
-   **Custom UI widgets** (custom Control Nodes and Scenes)
-   **Infinite scrolling container and grids of items**, split it by pages, animated dynamically
-   List **multiple pages of items** under the same category.
-   User interface that uses both Dynamic and Static data
-   **Equippable Item slots that accept configurable categories** of items and show the items equipped in these slots
-   Item and **equipment attributes**
-   Handling and **syncing of One Handed and Two Handed items,** while automatically unequipping items if both hands are equipped
-  **Pickable / Pickup items, dynamically adding them to the inventory** and listing them in the inventory screen, in the correct category
- UI sounds
- Godot version: **Godot 3.4.3** (Godot 4 is still too unstable and susceptible for breaking changes. When Godot 4 stable release comes out, the course and this source code will be upgraded).  

## Video Course
This source-code is built from scratch in the [**Complete Godot Course: Game User Interfaces Masterclass (Building a Dynamic Inventory System and UI with Godot)**](https://bit.ly/GodotUI). If you want to **learn how to make ALL of this from scratch**, check the course, while also support this project.

[![](./Assets/Docs/courseThumb-YouTube.jpg)](https://bit.ly/GodotUI)

**Game development course with 98 byte sized videos, with a total of 10 hours of video content**, where you are going to learn how to use the Godot Engine and Editor to create an **Inventory System and Inventory UI (User Interface) that is fully dynamic, with scriptable object items and a central database of items** (using Custom Godot's Resources). The inventory system has support for **multiple item categories, category groups, dynamic and infinite scrolling grids, equippable slots** (example: main hand and off hand) and more.
